These are loose notes for implementing some of the analysis on http://simulation.tbm.tudelft.nl/ema-workbench/

Algorithms
* PRIM
* SOM - self organizing maps
* decision trees
* PCA
* TSNE

stuff to analyze
behavior clustering - analyze populations, other stuff tbd

need some way to pick up on phase difference - granger causality, something else

could use sweave for documentation 

time series 
factor analysis - categories of results (i.e. decision tree)
network analysis 

dynamic versus static stability, exponential growth

mapping of input to output
- which initial conditions lead to stability, when do wolves die
-- what are the thresholds, where do things break down
- figure out how to find attractors
- what are all the things you can do to evaluate a signal
