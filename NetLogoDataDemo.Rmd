Analysis of NetLogo Data using R
========================================================

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

The main wiki page around these examples is at: http://wiki.tudelft.nl/bin/view/Education/SPM955xABMofCAS/LectureDataAnalysis

The code and data we will be using is at https://github.com/cbdavis/Demo-Analyzing-Netlogo-Data-with-R


```{r}
#Put this at the top of every file, unless you really really want to work with factors.
#This will save you a lot of confusion
options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

The contents are:
 * R code
 * the nlogo file used to generate the data. 
   This also includes methods that can write the network structure to a file (included as network.txt)
 * TeamAssemblyModelData.csv - the data from last year's exam

 Put all these into the same directory, open up RStudio
 and set your working directory to this directory containing the files. 
 Click on "Tools -> Set Working Directory -> Choose Directory" to do this. 
 On a mac, this may also be:
     "Session -> Set Working Directory -> Choose Directory" to do this.

Then install the necessary packages for R
 * In the bottom right quadrant, there is a "Packages" tab, with an option to "Install Packages". 
   Click on this to install the following libraries: 
   * ggplot2 - this will be used to do most of the plotting.
   * hexbin - used for one of the histogram examples
   * igraph - network analysis
   * sqldf - used for querying data, performing aggregations, filtering, etc.
   * reshape
