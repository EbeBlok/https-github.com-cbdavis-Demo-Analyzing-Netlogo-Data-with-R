This is code that is meant to demonstrate how R can be used to analyze data generated by <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/">NetLogo</a>.  In particular, the code demonstrates how to make many different types of graphs using <a href="http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/">ggplot2</a>.

The model analyzed is the <a href="https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/WolfSheepPredation">Wolf Sheep Predation Model</a>, and the model and data output are included here.

The code is heavily commented, and should work out-of-the-box.  The main things you need to check are your working directory and that you have the specified packages installed.
